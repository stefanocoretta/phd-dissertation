\section*{Abstract}
\end{center}

This dissertation focusses on the so-called 'voicing effect', by which vowels tend to be shorter when followed by voiceless stops and to be longer when followed by voiced stops, as exemplified by the English word pair *bat* vs. *bad*.
While the presence of this effect is cross-linguistically widespread, less is known about the source(s) of this phenomenon and competing accounts have been proposed over the decades.
In this work, I draw from acoustic and articulatory data of Italian, Polish, and English and offer an overarching account of which aspects of the production of voiceless vs. voiced stops, and vowel/consonant sequences in general, contribute to the emergence of the voicing effect.

The results indicate that the voicing effect is the product of a mechanism of compensation between the duration of the vowel and that of the following stop closure.
The acoustic temporal relations of consonants and vowels observed in disyllabic (CV́CV) words of Italian, Polish, and English suggest that the duration of the interval between the release of the two stops is not affected by the voicing of the second stop.
The release-to-release interval has similar duration in words with a voiceless C2 and those with a voiced C2.
Within this temporally stable interval, the timing of the closure onset (the VC boundary) determines the duration of both the vowel and the stop closure.

Ultrasound tongue imaging and electroglottographic data of Italian and Polish further show that the timing of the closure onset of voiced and voiced stops depends on articulatory factors related to the implementation of voicelessness and voicing.
In particular, I argue that a delayed closure onset allows for enough tongue root advancement (known to facilitate voicing during closure) to be implemented during the production of the vowel in anticipation of the stop closure.
Furthermore, glottal spreading typical of voiceless stops also can affect the timing of closure by anticipating the achievement of closure.
These two factors, among other known factors, contribute to the observed pattern of short voiced closures and long preceding vowel duration, and, vice versa, long voiceless closures and short preceding vowel duration.

I am for ever indebted to very many people, without whom I would not have seen the creased smear of light cast by the dawning Sun over the nightly horizon at the end of this journey.
A long journey that has witnessed bliss and sorrow, friends coming and parting, and lines of words, over words, over words.
But a joyful journey overall, thanks to the cheer and comfort I was given by those who, in full or in good measure, walked next to me along such perilous path.
Among these heroic figures, I wish to thank first and foremost my mentors, Dr Ricardo Bermúdez-Otero and Dr Patrycja Strycharczuk.
With perpetual patience and kindness, they offered to me in countless occasions guidance and inspiration.

I also wish to thank my colleagues, as well as friends, from the Division and the Phonetics Lab, to which I owe so much in terms of time, thoughts, and laughter.
Thanks to Simone, for the numerous chats about academia and life, for his moral support, and for the unicorn-shaped mug he had his coffee from, which gave to our time spent together a note of candour and light-heartedness.
Thanks to Andrea (Dr Andrea Nini), who taught me about matters of study and of day-to-day living.
Thanks must also go to Juliette, a companion of lunches and brunches, drinks and dinners, work sessions and pleasure trips, who brought constant light in cloudy Manchester and in my heart.

Thanks to the fellows I started this journey with: Stephen, to whom I am grateful for his continuous help and for our creative exchanges; and Donald, to whom I am grateful for the cheerful wit and the appreciation for the good things in life.
I have also received immense support from George, whose exchanges of ideas were a continuous inspiration, and from Hannah, whose calmness and poise helped me cherish the good and the bad times.
Last, but not least, a great thanks to all the other graduate students, some of whom were there before me, some of whom came later (Deepthi, Fernanda, Herni, Jane, Chriss, Max, Lorenzo, Kai, Sarah, Mary, and many others whom I wished I had the chance to know better), and to all the other members of staff at SALC who contributed each with their own field to my broader understanding of linguistics.



The tutelage and support of these and many more people came as those of \textit{Kṛṣṇa} upon \textit{Arjuna} in the \textit{Bhagavad-gitā}, during the battle at \textit{Kurukṣetra}.
Without their direction and kindness, I would have lost my way and strayed, bow broken, never to find again will to persist along the path.
Instead, they gave me strength to keep on aiming my arrows towards my purpose.
For all of you a thousand words, then a hundred, then another thousand, would not be enough.
