## The voicing effect and beyond

A long-recognised property of vowels is that their duration is influenced by the voicing of the consonant following them.
Across a wide variety of languages, vowels tend to be shorter when followed by voiceless consonants, and longer when followed by voiced ones.
This tendency has been called the 'voicing effect' \citep{mitleb1982}.
Remarkably, as far as we can tell, no language has been reported having the opposite effect, namely longer vowel durations before voiceless than before voiced consonants.
Possibly, the voicing effect is one of the most robust effects found in the phonetic literature (together with, for example, the effect of vowel height).
Among the earliest traceable mentions to the voicing effect there are \citet{meyer1903} for English (cited in \citealt{lindblom1967}), \citet{meyer1904} for German, \citet{meyer1909} for Hungarian, and \citet{gregoire1911} for French (all cited in \citealt{maddieson1976}).
After these, a plethora of studies confirmed the effect in these languages and reported it in other ones.

<!-- I need to talk about what I mean by voicing -->

English is by far the language that received the most attention (\citealt{heffner1937, house1953, lisker1957, zimmerman1958, peterson1960, house1961, sharf1962, sharf1964, lindblom1967, halle1967, halle1967a, slis1969a, slis1969, chen1970, klatt1973, lisker1974, raphael1975, umeda1975, javkin1976, port1982, mack1982, luce1985, van-summers1987, kluender1988, de-jong1991, laeufer1992, fowler1992, de-jong2004, lampp2004, warren2005, ko2018, glewwe2018, sanker2019}, among others).
The existence of the voicing effect has been further corroborated in French by \citet{belasco1953} and \citet{chen1970}, in Hungarian by \citet{soskuthy2013}, and German (in the context of word-final voicing neutralisation, see \citealt{nicenboim2018a} and references therein).
Other voicing-effect languages are Arabic, Assamese, Bengali, Dutch, Hindi, Italian \citep{caldognetto1979, farnetani1986, esposito2002}, Icelandic, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Swedish, Spanish, Telugu \citep{sanker2018}, and Russian [add references].
All of these languages, with the exception of Arabic, Korean, and Telugu, are Indo-European languages.
The sample is thus strongly biased from a typological perspective.
Moreover, the three non-Indo-European languages surveyed are well-studied languages in any case.
It will thus be vital, in the future, to investigate the voicing effect in underdescribed and underdocumented languages, from a wider variety of linguistic families and geographical locations.
This notwithstanding, the voicing effect is generally regarded as a very common and widespread phenomenon.

While the existence of the voicing effect is unquestionable, a commonly shared stance is that it is not an absolute universal, and that the magnitude of the effect varies across languages that have it.
Polish and Czech are generally reputed to be languages in which the duration of the vowel does not significantly differ before voiceless and voiced stops.
In fact, the results concerning the effect in these languages suggest both absence and presence of voicing-induced vowel duration differences.
As for Polish, \citet{slowiaczek1985} measured the duration of vowels in word-final syllables from 5 speakers, and vowels followed by an underlyingly voiced stop are 10--15 ms longer.
@nowak2006 investigates several properties of vowel duration in 4 speakers, and finds that vowels followed by voiced stops in 4 speakers (from different parts of Poland) are 4.5 ms longer (a significant difference).
<!-- I should read about what stats he did -->
@malisz2008 analyse data from 40 speakers of 'Standard Polish', and while they don't report estimates from the whole dataset, the means from 4 speakers suggest a difference in vowel duration before voiceless vs. voiced stops of about 3.5 ms.
On the other hand, an equal number of studies argue that voicing does not significantly affect vowel duration.
\citet{jassem1989} could not replicate the results in \citet{slowiaczek1985}.
\citet{keating1984} reports a non-significant difference of 2 ms in the word pair /rata/ (167.4) and /rada/ (169.5 ms), based on data from 24 speakers in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.
Finally, \citet{strycharczuk2012a} reports a non-significant effect in 6 speakers in pre-sonorant word-final position.
