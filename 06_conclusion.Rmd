This dissertation investigated the influence of consonant voicing on vowel duration by focussing on production aspects of vowel-consonant sequences.
As a cross-linguistic tendency, vowels are shorter when followed by voiceless consonants and longer when followed by voiced ones.
Several proposals as to what mechanisms underly this tendency have been put forward, but no account has won consensus.
Two studies were carried out to investigate durational and articulatory properties of vowels and consonants in Italian, Polish, and English.
Five papers presented and discussed the results from these studies.
Paper I and II show that the duration of the interval between the releases of the stops of a disyllabic word is not affected by the voicing of the second stop in Italian, Polish, and English.
On the other hand, the release-to-release interval of English monosyllabic words is longer when the second consonant is voiced.
The results in Paper III suggest the existence of a statistical correlation between vowel duration and degree of tongue root advancement, such that longer vowel durations correspond to greater tongue root advancement.
Finally, in Paper V it was speculated that the timing of the stop closure is modulated by the presence of emerging voiceless pre-aspiration, so that either enhancement of pre-aspiration delays closure or its prevention anticipates it.
This chapter provides an over-arching synthesis of the account proposed here in light of the observed patterns, and discusses the implications for theories of speech production.

## A pluralist view
\label{s:pluralist}

The results of Study I and II bring together aspects of gestural compensation and articulatory timing and allow us to formulate a more holistic account that incorporates components of different accounts.
Two important aspects of the account proposed here are the temporal stability of vocalic and consonantal gestures, and the timing of the vowel-consonant boundary.
The gestural temporal stability is one fundamental aspect of the compensatory temporal adjustment account.
The articulatory temporal stability across voicing contexts is evidenced by the durational stability of the interval between two consecutive stop releases.
The duration of this release-to-release interval is not affected by the voicing of the second stop.
However, while the original compensatory account states that the stop closure duration *determines* the duration of the preceding vowel, the formulation of the account proposed here takes a more neutral position.
The timing of the VC boundary within the release-to-release interval determines the durations of *both* the vowel and closure.

The second fundamental aspect of the holistic account is that the timing of the VC boundary is modulated by aspects that would fall under the laryngeal adjustments and the rate of closure accounts.
The ultrasound and EGG data from Study I, as discussed in Papers III--V, suggest that mechanisms independent from closure duration per se can act upon the timing of the VC boundary and, indirectly, on the duration of closure.
For one, tongue root position might influence the timing of the boundary by delaying it to allow for greater tongue root advancement, which is known to facilitate voicing during the production of the stop closure (see Paper III).
Second, the development of pre-aspiration could also influence the timing of the VC boundary by delaying or anticipating it depending on whether pre-aspiration is enhanced or prevented (Paper V).

Moreover, the account proposed here is diachronic in nature, in as much as it reveals a possible historical pathway to the emergence of the difference in vowel duration rooted in production aspects of vowels and consonants.
In particular, I argue that the voicing effect can emerge because of the temporal stability of CVC sequences and the differences in timing of the closure in voiceless and voiced stops.
Such an account assumes that the original scenario is one in which the duration of vowels and that of closures do not differ across voicing contexts.
Speakers would start producing the difference via developmental learning or historical change.
On top of this, when VV isochrony does not constrain the temporal distances in CVC sequences, vowel and closure durations are free to be manipulated independently with the aim of enhancing VC ratio differences, as argued by perceptual accounts of the voicing effect.

While the account proposed here is based on production mechanisms, it cannot be completely excluded that the production differences observed and stipulated here are a consequence of perceptual biases.
In such a scenario, there could be a design feature of the perceptual system that generates the differential duration percept, even when there is not such difference in the acoustic output/input.
An example from the domain of vision illustrates this possibility.
When looking at a wheel spinning in a clockwise direction, the observer will see the wheel rotating counter-clockwise when the rotation speed exceeds a threshold.
There is nothing in the mechanics of a wheel spinning around its axis that can explain this perceptual fact.
Rather, visual processing has a design feature (for example, vision refresh rate) that creates the illusion of the wheel spinning in the opposite direction.
In this example, the wheel and its percept are two clearly separable ontological entities, so that the percept cannot change how the wheel is spinning.
In the case of speech, however, a bias in the the perceptual system can (and very often does) result into difference in production.

Teasing apart production and perceptual mechanisms in speech is more difficult than in the spinning wheel case, since production and perception operate within a single agent, i.e. the speaker/hearer.
On the other hand, when we can find independent physical explanations behind production biases, we can considered them design features of the production system, and not just a consequence of perceptual biases.
Since in the case of voicing there are independent production reasons for the observed patterns to exist, we can assume that, while perceptual biases can hook on the vowel duration differences as a cue to voicing and enhance such contrast, these differences emerge due to a production mechanism in the first place.

## Gestural phasing
\label{s:gestural-phasing}

As argued in Paper II, the temporal stability of the release-to-release interval is compatible with hypotheses about the gestural organisation of vowel and consonants within the domains of the syllable and the word.
According to the coupled oscillators model \citep{odell2008}, embedded in the task-dynamic model of Articulatory Phonology \citep{ohala1986a, browman1988, browman2000, goldstein2006, goldstein2014}, speech gestures can be implemented according to two coupling modes: in-phase or anti-phase mode.
When two or more gestures are in an in-phase relation, they are initiated in synchrony.
If two or more gestures follow an anti-phase coupling mode, the gestures are implemented sequentially and one gesture starts when the preceding one has reached its target.
These two coupling modes can account for temporal aspects observed in the relative phasing of consonants and vowels.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{./img/gest-align.pdf}
  \caption{Gestural organisation patterns for onsets (a) and codas (b). C = consonant, V = vowel (design based on \citealt{marin2010}).}
  \label{fig:gorganisation}
\end{figure}

\citet{marin2010} show that onset consonants in American English are in-phase with respect to the vowel nucleus and anti-phase with each other.
Such phasing pattern establishes a stable relationship between the centre of the consonant (or consonants in a cluster) and the following vowel.
Independent of the number of onset consonants, the temporal midpoint of the onset (the so-called 'C-centre') is maintained at a fixed distance from the vowel, such that an increasing number of consonants in the onset does not change the distance between the vowel and the C-centre (\Cref{fig:gorganisation}a).
On the other hand, coda consonants are in an anti-phase relation with the preceding vowel and between themselves.
When consonants are added to the coda, they are sequentially realised.
Temporal stability in codas is found in the lag between the vowel and the left-most edge of the coda, which is not affected by the number of coda consonants (\Cref{fig:gorganisation}b).
Other studies found further evidence for the synchronous and sequential coupling modes (see extensive review in \citealt{marin2010} and \citealt{marin2014}), although the use of one mode over the other depends on the language and the consonants under study \citep{pouplier2012}.
Consonants can thus be said to follow either a C-centre or a left-edge organisation pattern depending on whether they are in-phase or anti-phase with the vocalic gesture.

Phasing modes are defined within the traditional syllable, or, in other words, relative to the tautosyllabic vowel (the following vowel for onsets and the preceding vowel for codas).
Less is known about the relation between heterosyllabic segments and how syllables are timed and phased within words.
\citet{ohman1967} and \citet{fowler1983} propose that vocalic gestures are implemented according to a rhythmic programme and that consonantal (constriction gestures) are superimposed to the vocalic gestural stream.
Furthermore, the authors argue that the timing of vocalic gestures follows a regular cyclic pattern, which is in turn responsible for the rhythmic patterns of speech.
\citet{fowler1983} reviews a collection of findings from speech production, perception, and phonological patterns that support the idea of a cyclic production of vowels.

A consequence of the cyclic production of vowels and the independence of the vocalic and consonantal gestures is that two consecutive vowels within a word would be at a stable temporal distance, independent of the nature and number of the intervening consonants.
This hypothesis, however, is not borne out by the empirical evidence in \citet{zmarich2011} and \citet{zeroual2015}.
Using electromagnetic articulography, both studies find that the distance between two vowels is greater when the intervening consonant is a geminate compared to when it is a singleton consonant.
Furthermore, \citet{de-jong1991} finds only partial support for the independence of vowel and consonant gestures.
These studies also find substantial inter-speaker variation in the particulars of the gestural implementation of vowel-consonant sequences.

While the strong prediction of vowel-to-vowel isochrony is not confirmed by data comparing singleton and geminates, a weaekr formulation of cyclicity might still be appropriate.
A possible reason for why the isochrony breaks in the geminate context is that geminate consonants are a blend of two phasing patterns.
For example, \citet{zeroual2015} argue that their findings support the interpretation of geminates as two identical consonants produced sequentially.
This would mean that the first part of the geminate is implemented anti-phase with the preceding vowel, while the second part is articulated in-phase with the following.
The presence of an anti-phase gesture intervening between the vowels could be responsible for the disruption of the vowel-to-vowel isochrony.
If this is the case, then isochrony would apply only in those cases where the intervening consonants are in-phase with the second vowel (see \Cref{s:final} for a set of hypotheses).

Turning to the voicing contrast, since CVCV words differing in the voicing of C2 just include a singleton consonant, we can expect VV isochrony to apply.
Since onset consonants are in-phase with the tautosyllabic vowel and the timing of the release of C2 is not affected by voicing, the timing of the gestural onset of voiceless and voiced stops should also be identical.
<!-- TODO: schematics -->
This is in part confirmed by the ultrasound tongue imaging data of Study I (see \Cref{a:gons}).
The duration of the interval between the acoustic release of C1 and the gestural onset time of C2 is not affected by the voicing status of C2.
On the other hand, the velocity of the closing gesture is known to differ in voiceless vs. voiced stops \citep{van-summers1987}.
<!-- TODO: say that velocity data are not good here? -->
While the timing of gestural onset is identical in both voicing contexts, the difference in closing velocity produces the acoustic pattern of the differential timing of the VC boundary.
Faster closing velocity in voiceless stops creates an early VC boundary, while a slow closing gesture generates a later VC boundary.

On the other hand, in tautosyllabic VC sequences, the consonant gesture is implemented anti-phase with the preceding vowel, meaning that the gestures are produced sequentially.
In such case, VV isochrony is broken and the duration of V1 can be modulated freely without proportionally affecting closure duration.
This is what it is argued to happen in monosyllabic words, where the distance between the releases of C1 and C2 differs depending on C2 voicing.
\citet{de-jong1991} indeed finds that, in English monosyllabic words, not only the velocity of the coda closing gesture differs depending on voicing, but also that the timing of the coda gesture onset does (the gesture onset is timed later during the production of the vowel in the context of voiced stops relative to that of voiceless stops).

## On cross-linguistic differences
\label{s:cross-ling-diff}

As discussed in \Cref{s:ve}, the degree of the voicing effect is generally thought to vary depending on the language.
Allegedly, English is the language possessing the biggest effect, while the effect is smaller in Italian and possibly absent in Polish.
However, Papers I and II indicate a somewhat different scenario.
A direct comparison of the data from Study I and II is not straightforward, given the different materials used in the two studies, but it still provides us with some directions as to what difference, if any, there are between the languages in question.
A Bayesian analysis of the effect of voicing in disyllabic words comparing English, Italian, and Polish (see \Cref{a:ve-comp}) suggests that, when controlling for differences in average baseline vowel duration and speech rate, there is no strong evidence for a difference in the effect of voicing across these languages.
Note, however, that no conclusive statement can be done in this regard, due to the low precision of the relevant estimates obtained in the meta-analysis.

Crucially, previous work \citep{sharf1962, klatt1973}, and in some part the results in Paper II, indicate there is a tendency for the effect in English to be greater in monosyllabic than disyllabic words.
It is important, then, that differences across languages are tested directly and within the same phonological contexts.
An example of this approach is the study in \citet{laeufer1992}, who shows that the effect in English and French is comparable when the vowel baseline duration is analogous.

Moreover, the results of the Bayesian meta-analysis of the English voicing effect (\Cref{a:ve-eng}) indicate that, while there is clearly a positive effect of voicing on vowel duration, less can be said about the magnitude of such effect.
Although the estimated range of values is between 55 and 95 ms, the analysis revealed a possibility for publication bias in favour of larger effects, meaning that the obtained values might be overestimated.
Note also that there could be differences in speech rate across studies which cannot be controlled for, and older studies might have obtained data based on lower speech rates (which could explain the greater baseline vowel duration in these studies).
The smaller effect found in Study II is indicative of such differences.
For example, the intercept estimate of vowel duration before voiceless stops is about 125 ms in Study II, but the average vowel duration in the meta-analytical data is 150 ms.
Although the voicing effect does not scale linearly with vowel duration, as suggested by \citet{ko2018}, slower speech rates (i.e. longer vowel durations) would correspond to a greater effect of voicing.

\citet{tanner2019} argue that the effect they found in spontaneous speech is smaller than that of laboratory speech reported in previous studies.
However, when their results are compared to those of Study II, this apparent difference is substantially reduced.
The ratio of the difference in vowel duration in \citet{tanner2019} is estimated to be between 1 and 1.16.
The ratio in Study II is between 1.03 and 1.17, a range that is virtually identical to that of \citet{tanner2019}.

I am not claiming, however, that the voicing effect is necessarily universal.
Especially in the case of monosyllabic words, as argued above, language-specific perceptual enhancement can modulate the magnitude of the effect.
For example, \citet{tanner2019} demonstrate that, although not unambiguously, the effect of voicing on vowel duration in monosyllabic words differs across varieties of English.
More work is needed to assess cross-linguistic differences with a sufficiently sampled dataset and by experimental procedures designed to reduce phonological differences.

# Implications and future research
\label{s:final}

The aim of this dissertation was to investigate properties of speech production that could illuminate the debate on the origin of the effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration.
While the results of this endeavour contributed to answering the questions introduced in \Cref{s:resq}, some open issues remain and new questions are brought to light.
The following paragraphs review these and offer some final thoughts on future directions of research.

The use of nonce words in the present experiments might be seen as problematic due to the fact that they might have encouraged unnatural speech.
However, using nonce words has the perk of facilitating experimental design and control over phonological factors.
Note that phonetic effects like the ones under discussion can operate according to analogical processes based on stored exemplars and/or abstract representations.
Hence, even if unnatural speech materials were used here, these studies should have tapped into the speakers' knowledge, even though indirectly.
Moreover, nonce words eliminate issues related to usage factors like lexical frequency, which can have a substantial influence \citep{hay2015, soskuthy2017a, soskuthy2018, todd2019}.
On the other hand, neighbourhood density was not controlled for, a factor which is also known to play a role \citep{baese-berk2009, goldrick2013, seyfarth2016, glewwe2018}.
It is desirable that future work investigates the patterns observed here using real words, while carefully controlling for lexical frequency and neighbourhood density, among other usage factors.

A limitation of the studies in this work is related to statistical precision of the effect estimates.
As discussed throughout this dissertation, some of the effects have quite large confidence/credible intervals.
In some cases, like in the cross-linguistic comparative analysis of the voicing effect, making unambiguous inferential statements becomes difficult.
Possibly, much of this uncertainty derives from the sample sizes employed in these studies.
Although the number of speakers included here is generally similar to or greater than average (see \Cref{a:speakers}), the number of observations might not have been sufficient enough to reach an appreciable degree of precision.
The results discussed in this dissertation stress how important obtaining a sufficient sample is, especially when dealing with small effect sizes.
Much of the phonetic literature relies on small sample sizes, but most work is done on data which is typically statistically noisy.

Moreover, arguments of effect size are very often used to make statements about what constitute a theoretically relevant effect.
However, much of phonetics and phonological theory makes qualitative rather than precise quantitative predictions, and argumentations on the theoretical relevance of effect sizes at present are probably biased due to the issues discussed in \Cref{s:openscience}.
In any case, precision targets based on just noticeable differences have restricted scope.
For example, \citet{huggins1972} shows that the perceptual threshold for segment durations varies depending on the type and baseline duration of the segment (cf. the Weber–Fechner law, \citealt{fechner1966}).
Speakers can reliably detect differences of down to 5 ms with vowels that are 90 ms long \citep{nooteboom1980}.
Furthermore, these perceptual thresholds might be relevant only within the task they have been elicited in, and in more natural contexts even smaller differences could be perceptible in conjunction with other, possibly more robust, cues.
In sum, our current knowledge of perceptible differences is still limited, and future work should focus on investigating this matter both in light of theoretical and practical considerations.
Until we can establish with certainty what differences in which contexts are physiologically impossible to be perceived, it is probably wise to report even very small, seemingly irrelevant effects while aiming at the highest level of precision possible.

This dissertation focusses on the voicing effect of stop consonants, but other manners of articulation participate in the effect.
According to the compensatory account presented here, a greater difference in consonant duration should correspond to a greater voicing effect.
For example, \citet{crystal1988} report a greater difference in fricative duration than in stop duration, which would be compatible with a greater voicing effect in the former.
However, while \citet{house1953} and \citet{peterson1960} find that the effect is greater in fricatives than in stops, \citet{tanner2019} observe the opposite trend.
Future work should directly test the relation between differences in consonant duration and the voicing effect with consonants belonging to different manners of articulation.

The compensatory account presented here rests on the cyclic production of vocalic gestures \citep{ohman1967, fowler1983}.
\citet{zmarich2011} and \citet{zeroual2015} demonstrate that the temporal distance between two vowels with an intervening stop differs depending on whether the stop is a singleton or a geminate (e.g. *aba* vs *abba*, the distance is greater in the latter case).
However, I argue that the absence of vowel-to-vowel isochrony across these contexts follows from the gestural organisation of the segments involved.
In the case of singleton stops, the vocalic gestures are executed consecutively and the intervocalic consonant is executed synchronously with the the second vowel (\Cref{fig:vv-cent}a top).
In the case of geminates, on the other hand, the intervening consonant is the outcome of the double selection of a single gesture where the first selection is executed anti-phase with the first vowel and the second in-phase with the second vowel (\Cref{fig:vv-cent}a bottom).
The gesture of the second vowel is initiated after the completion of the intervening anti-phase gesture and in synchrony with the in-phase gesture.
As a consequence, the gestural onset of the second consonant is delayed in the geminate context relative to the singleton context.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{./img/vv-cent.pdf}
  \caption{Schematics of the gestural phasing of vocalic and consonantal gestures in four different contexts. (a) shows singleton vs. geminate stops, while in (b) voiceless and voiced stops are contrasted. Note that in (a) the distance between the vowels increases in the geminate context, while it is stable in (b). The different slopes of the closing part of the gesture in /t/ vs. /d/ accounts for the difference in acoustic closure onset.}
  \label{fig:vv-cent}
\end{figure}

Future work should investigate vowel-to-vowel isochrony within contexts that have a comparable phasing profile (for example, within CV.CV words and within CVC.CV, but not across the two).
The acoustic patterns discussed in this dissertation assume that the distance between the vowels in CV.CV words is not affected by the second consonant and that the timing of the gestural onset and release are the same independent of voicing, while the velocity profiles of the closing gesture differs (\Cref{fig:vv-cent}b).
By extension, I propose that the vowel-to-vowel interval should be isochronous when comparing different manners of articulation, like in pairs such as Italian /kadi/ and /kazi/.
Jaw displacement could be employed as an index of the gestural timing of the vocalic gestures in plurisyllabic words \citep{menezes2013, erickson2016, kawahara2017}.
The temporal distance between the onsets or maxima of jaw displacement should be identical or very similar across voicing contexts, place of articulation, and manner of the intervening consonant.
