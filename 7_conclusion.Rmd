# General discussion

This dissertation investigated the influence of consonant voicing on vowel duration by focussing on production aspects of vowel-consonant sequences.
As a cross-linguistic tendency, vowels are shorter when followed by voiceless consonants and longer when followed by voiced ones.
Several proposals as to what mechanisms underly this tendency have been proposed, but no account has won consensus.
Two studies were carried out to investigate durational and articulatory properties of vowels and consonants in Italian, Polish, and English.
Five papers presented and discussed the results from these studies.
Paper I and [...] show that the duration of the interval between the releases of the stops of a disyllabic word is not affected by the voicing of the second stop in Italian, Polish, and English.
On the other hand, the release-to-release interval of English monosyllabic words is longer when the second consonant is voiced.
The results in Paper [...] suggest the existence of a statistical correlation between vowel duration and degree of tongue root advancement, such that longer vowel durations correspond to greater tongue root advancement.
Finally, in Paper [...] it was speculated that the timing of the stop closure is modulated by the presence of emerging voiceless pre-aspiration, so that either enhancement of pre-aspiration delays closure or its prevention anticipates it.
This chapter provides an over-arching synthesis of the account proposed here in light of the observed patterns, and discusses the implications for theories of speech production.

## Gestural phasing

As argued in Paper [...], the temporal stability of the release-to-release interval is compatible with hypotheses about the gestural organisation of vowel and consonants within the domains of the syllable and the word.
According to the coupled oscillators model \citep{odell2008}, embedded in the task-dynamic model of Articulatory Phonology \citep{ohala1986a, browman1988, browman2000, goldstein2006, goldstein2014}, speech gestures can be implemented according to two coupling modes: in-phase (synchronous) or anti-phase (sequential) mode.
When two or more gestures are in an in-phase relation, they are initiated in synchrony.
If two or more gestures follow an anti-phase coupling mode, the gestures are implemented sequentially and one gesture starts when the preceding one has reached its target.
These two coupling modes can account for temporal aspects observed in the relative phasing of coda and onsets consonants with vowels.

<!-- TODO: cite Pouplier universal chapter -->
\citet{marin2010} showed that onset consonants in American English are in-phase with respect to the vowel nucleus and anti-phase with each other.
Such phasing pattern establishes a stable relationship between the centre of the consonant (or consonants in a cluster) and the following vowel.
Independent of the number of onset consonants, the temporal midpoint of the onset consonant(s) (the so-called 'C-centre') is maintained at a fixed distance from the vowel, such that an increasing number of consonants in the onset does not change the distance between the vowel and the onset C-centre (\Cref{f:gorganisation}a).
On the other hand, coda consonants are in an anti-phase relation with the preceding vowel and between themselves.
When consonants are added to the coda, they are sequentially realised.
Temporal stability in codas is found in the lag between the vowel and the left-most edge of the coda, which is not affected by the number of coda consonants (\Cref{f:gorganisation}b).
Other studies found further evidence for the synchronous and sequential coupling modes (see extensive review in \citealt{marin2010} and \citealt{marin2014}), although the use of one mode over the other depends on the language and the consonants under study [...].

Consonants can thus be said to follow either a C-centre or a left-edge organisation pattern.
In both cases, of course, the pattern is relative to the tautosyllabic vowel (the following vowel for onsets, the preceding vowel for codas).
To the best of my knowledge, no study has reported the timing of onset consonants relative to the *preceding* (heterosyllabic) vowel.
