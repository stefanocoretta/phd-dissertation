# General discussion

This dissertation investigated the influence of consonant voicing on vowel duration by focussing on production aspects of vowel-consonant sequences.
As a cross-linguistic tendency, vowels are shorter when followed by voiceless consonants and longer when followed by voiced ones.
Several proposals as to what mechanisms underly this tendency have been proposed, but no account has won consensus.
Two studies were carried out to investigate durational and articulatory properties of vowels and consonants in Italian, Polish, and English.
Five papers presented and discussed the results from these studies.
Paper I and [...] show that the duration of the interval between the releases of the stops of a disyllabic word is not affected by the voicing of the second stop in Italian, Polish, and English.
On the other hand, the release-to-release interval of English monosyllabic words is longer when the second consonant is voiced.
The results in Paper [...] suggest the existence of a statistical correlation between vowel duration and degree of tongue root advancement, such that longer vowel durations correspond to greater tongue root advancement.
Finally, in Paper [...] it was speculated that the timing of the stop closure is modulated by the presence of emerging voiceless pre-aspiration, so that either enhancement of pre-aspiration delays closure or its prevention anticipates it.
This chapter provides an over-arching synthesis of the account proposed here in light of the observed patterns, and discusses the implications for theories of speech production.
