# Introduction

Furthermore, while the voicing effect is not an exclusive feature of stop consonants, we chose to limit the investigation on this type of segments due to methodological constraints.

This thesis set out to collect acoustic and articulatory data that would enable a free exploration of the hypothesis space.
This is where the first of the two studies that form part of this thesis stands.
An exploratory study of several aspects of the influence of voicing on vowel duration sought to provide data without constraining the experimental design in light of a particular hypothesis.
The results of this study suggested a promising venue for a further investigation of the compensatory temporal adjustment account.
A second study was thus planned to test the hypotheses generated in the previous exploration.

The temporal stability of the interval in disyllabic words is argued to derive from the combined action of vowel-to-vowel isochrony within the word and of the synchronous implementation of the vocalic and consonant gestures within the syllable.

Until we can establish with certainty what differences in which contexts are physiologically impossible to be perceived, an alternative solution could be to use measurement precision as a threshold.
For example, \citet{allen1978} shows that the 95% confidence intervals of vowels measured by accurate phoneticians ranges between 10 and 25 ms.
We could take the smallest value (10 ms) as representative of a region of practical equivalence (see ...).
This means that differences smaller than 5 ms would be interpreted as noise.
On the other hand, \citet{begus2017} reports very small standard errors, even below 1 ms.
In sum, our current knowledge of perceptible and measurable differences is limited, and future work should focus on investigating both in light of theoretical and practical considerations.

<!-- The specific questions touched upon in this dissertation encompass topics at the intersection between phonetics and phonology \citep{ohala1990, ohala1997, ohala2005, port2005, cohn2010}, and cover both concrete, observable phenomena, and abstract, formalised aspects of speech processing.
Among the questions posed by this work there are the following:

* Can the voicing effect be ascribed to mechanisms of temporal compensation and/or articulatory adjustments that result in the observed patters of both vowel and consonant duration?
* Which articulatory properties of voicing directly affect vowel and consonant durations, and in particular what mechanisms influence the timing of the consonantal closure?
* Do voiceless and voiced consonants target different articulatory realisations, or are there some oral and/or laryngeal configurations or processes that are shared between them?
* Do these aspects of production follow universal patterns and constraints, or can different languages modulate their implementation in specific ways?
* Can the mechanisms behind the voicing effect inform us on more general aspects of gestural phasing and articulatory timing within and beyond the traditional syllable?
* Can the study of articulation provide us with insights into the enhancing role of perception?
* What can we learn about other durational effects from the study of the voicing effect?
* Can the magnitudes of the voicing effect reported in previous studies be replicated with new data, and what research aspects could be responsible for differences?
* What level of confidence can we attribute to previous and current results, considering the weight of the evidence provided by the data? -->
