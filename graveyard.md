# Introduction

Furthermore, while the voicing effect is not an exclusive feature of stop consonants, we chose to limit the investigation on this type of segments due to methodological constraints.

This thesis set out to collect acoustic and articulatory data that would enable a free exploration of the hypothesis space.
This is where the first of the two studies that form part of this thesis stands.
An exploratory study of several aspects of the influence of voicing on vowel duration sought to provide data without constraining the experimental design in light of a particular hypothesis.
The results of this study suggested a promising venue for a further investigation of the compensatory temporal adjustment account.
A second study was thus planned to test the hypotheses generated in the previous exploration.
