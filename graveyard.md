# Introduction

Furthermore, while the voicing effect is not an exclusive feature of stop consonants, we chose to limit the investigation on this type of segments due to methodological constraints.

This thesis set out to collect acoustic and articulatory data that would enable a free exploration of the hypothesis space.
This is where the first of the two studies that form part of this thesis stands.
An exploratory study of several aspects of the influence of voicing on vowel duration sought to provide data without constraining the experimental design in light of a particular hypothesis.
The results of this study suggested a promising venue for a further investigation of the compensatory temporal adjustment account.
A second study was thus planned to test the hypotheses generated in the previous exploration.

The temporal stability of the interval in disyllabic words is argued to derive from the combined action of vowel-to-vowel isochrony within the word and of the synchronous implementation of the vocalic and consonant gestures within the syllable.

Until we can establish with certainty what differences in which contexts are physiologically impossible to be perceived, an alternative solution could be to use measurement precision as a threshold.
For example, \citet{allen1978} shows that the 95% confidence intervals of vowels measured by accurate phoneticians ranges between 10 and 25 ms.
We could take the smallest value (10 ms) as representative of a region of practical equivalence (see ...).
This means that differences smaller than 5 ms would be interpreted as noise.
On the other hand, \citet{begus2017} reports very small standard errors, even below 1 ms.
In sum, our current knowledge of perceptible and measurable differences is limited, and future work should focus on investigating both in light of theoretical and practical considerations.
